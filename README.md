# SED Spectral Classification

Classify spectral type of stars from single wide-band observations. 
The PSF-aware classifier takes into account the spectral variation of the telescope's PSF for breaking the degeneracy between the stellar type and the PSF size, hence enhancing the classification accuracy.
