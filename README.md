# SED Spectral Classification

Classify spectra of stars from the polychromatic star observations into 13 star types. Take into account the spectral variation of the telescope's PSF for the classification. 

Three different classifiers are tested and contrasted:
- PCA+MLP classifier.
- CNN+MLP classifier.
- SVM+PSF classifier.
